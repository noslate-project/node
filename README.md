## Contributing

Anode project follows the work in the upstream [nodejs/node][]. Changes to this project should align with our project priorities as:

1. Startup performance improvements.
1. Optimization dedicated to the [OpenAnolis][] and its platforms.
1. Optimization dedicated to the Alibaba Cloud infrastructure.

With Noslate team's discretion, any changes that are not in accord with the above priorities should be considered to be submitted to the upstream instead.
